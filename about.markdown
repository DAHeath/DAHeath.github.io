Hi! My name is David Heath. I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech.
My advisor is [Bill Harris](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~wharris/).

My interests include:
  + Compiler Design
  + Programming Language Design
  + Static Analysis of Programs
  + Functional Programming

Overall, I focus on program safety: I want programmer's to be able to build
programs which are more and more provably correct.

If you're at Tech, you can find me at KACB Room 2319 on weekdays.
