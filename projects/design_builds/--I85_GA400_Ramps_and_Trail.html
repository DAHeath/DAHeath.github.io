  The Georgia Department of Transportation selected the design/build team of
  Archer Western Contractors and Heath & Lineback Engineers, Inc. to complete
  the system-to-system interchange of GA 400 with I-85 in Atlanta, Georgia.
  Originally built in the 1990s, the interchange was not “complete” in that not
  all ramps were included.  The new ramps provide I-85 southbound traffic with
  direct access to GA 400 northbound and also give GA 400 southbound motorists a
  direct ramp to I-85 northbound.  Significant traffic growth and projections
  for future demand made it vital to add these ramps – under the constraint of
  keeping the existing interchange in service.

  Through local resident input, the project was expanded to include a ½ mile
  recreational trail (North Fork Creekside Trail) along the banks of North Fork
  Peachtree Creek and through the urban forest within the broad tract of
  right-of-way available at the interchange.  The trail includes a 165 foot
  clear span bridge over the creek, three minor stream crossings, and several
  walls built to avoid unsightly cut and fill slopes.  Designed by H&L, this is
  the first nature trail built by the Georgia Department of Transportation.
