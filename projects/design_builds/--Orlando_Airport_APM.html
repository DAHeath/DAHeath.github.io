  The Orlando International Airport is undergoing a $470 million expansion to the south of the airportâ€™s main terminal complex.  The expansion includes a new APM station, APM system, ground transportation center, 3500 space parking garage, and supporting roadway/infrastructure system.  This project consists of designing, fabricating, and installing the operating systems (OS) of the APM.  The scope of work includes the OS for the South Airport Complex APM system and the replacement of Airsides 1 and 3 OS, which includes new vehicles, train controls, and running surfaces - all through a Design/Build/Operate/Maintain (DBOM) contract.

The work includes the design, manufacture, installation, integration, testing and commissioning, and safety certification of the APM OS equipment.  This equipment consists of vehicles/trains, guidance equipment, communications equipment, command and control equipment, station equipment, a power distribution system, supporting equipment for maintenance facility operations, public information, and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) systems. After safety certification, the APM System Supplier will provide Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services to the Aviation Authority for the systems installed by the supplier.
