Heath & Lineback Engineers was retained by Recchi America, Inc. the general contractor, to perform construction engineering and develop a complete erection scheme and shop drawing package.

 <p>
 Our staff designed precast segmental concrete stay-in-place soffit forms, monolithic with, and supporting a tremie seal, which, in turn, acted as the base for a massive suspended pier cap for the drilled shaft foundations.  A combined pier table falsework and balanced cantilever stability system was developed to allow construction of the 42-foot by 38-foot pier table and later to stabilize the 650-foot cantilever through the use of 42-inch diameter concrete-filled steel tubes.

Heath & Lineback also analyzed the stresses, strains, deflections, camber and time-dependent effects of the erection scheme for the balanced cantilever and spans, and designed pile supported falsework for the approach spans. This falsework consisted of box trusses spanning up to 60 feet.

The twin 1,645-foot concrete segmental structure with a 650-foot main span was designed to replace a structurally deficient four-lane girder truss lift-span bridge. Each bridge is 78 feet wide for four lanes of vehicular traffic and one light rail track.
